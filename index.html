# 1. Attacks on OSS distribution

---

## Risk Analysis

Should we care?

Would attacks on OSS have impact?

???

Arnout: before we start talking about securing the OSS build and
distribution pipeline, let's talk about whether it is worth it. Spoiler
alert: we think it is.

Show of hands: who is developer? uses OSS? professionally?

---

## Risk Analysis

Should we care?

Would attacks on OSS have impact?

### Black Duck Open Source Survey 2016

* Surveyed 1.300+ companies
* 78% "of companies *run on open source*"

???

Perhaps not a representative sample, but OSS is *everywhere*.
Large financial institutions, big tech corps, all are heavily
reliant on open source these days

---

## Risk Analysis

Should we care?

Would attacks on OSS have impact?

### Black Duck Open Source Survey 2016

Top 3 reasons to use FLOSS:

1. Quality of solutions
2. Features and Technical Capabilities
3. Ability to customize and fix

_66% of companies consider FLOSS options before proprietary alternatives._

???

Often a default choice!

---

## Risk Analysis

Should we care?

Would attacks on OSS have impact?

### Use of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense

DoD was a major user of FOSS, even in mission-critial situations (2003). A report was issued.

## Risk Analysis

Should we care?

Would attacks on OSS have impact?

### Use of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense

DoD was a major user of FOSS, even in mission-critial situations (2003). A report was issued:

* DoD security depends heavily on FOSS
* Don't ban FOSS at the DoD!
* Instead, promote broader and more effective use of FOSS at the DoD. **Moar!**

## Risk Analysis

Should we care?

Are OSS developers being targeted?

Arnout: Problem not unique to FLOSS: https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/30/17630664/steam-abstractism-cryptocurrency-mining - but FLOSS in unique position to combat it

* All builders should arrive at the exact same artifact!

---

# 3. Other advantages

* Detect security issues (private key generation on build).
* Less rebuilds due to caching results since they are the same.
* Bugs found in packages when building in different environments.
* Builds which fail X% of the time.

TODO Arnout: verder invullen.

# 4. In practice

How hard can it be to reproduce software?

---

# 4. In practice

First Debian rebuild in 2013 24% packages reproducible

---

# 5. Problems & Tools

---

# Problems

* Dictionary/hash/database ordering
* Build paths
* Timestamps
* Non-determinismistic file ordering
* Private keys/seeds
* Users, groups, umask, environment variables, etc.

---

# Timestamps

```bash
- V2.0-000..Wed·Feb·13·23:10:22·20
+ V2.0-000..Wed·Mar·18·05:31:03·20
```

---

# File ordering

```bash
 return (
-	'/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/server',
-	'/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/jli',
  '/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64',
+	'/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/jli',
+	'/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/server',

# Security issues

```

---

# Tools

* diffoscope
* disorderfs
* reprotest
* strip-nondeterminism

???

* diffoscope - file diff++
* disorderfs - a FUSE fs which introduces non-determinism
* reprotest- build packages twice in different environments
* strip-nondeterminism - build system tool to strip some sorts of non determinism
used by Debian

---

# diffoscope

Also known as diff on steroids


```bash
$ diffoscope badge-firmware.bin /tmp/badge-firmware.bin

```

https://try.diffoscope.org

???

Diffs two files with support for a lot of formats which are automatically 'unpacked' in the most
convenient format.

---

# diffoscope supported files

Android APK files, Android boot images, Ar(1) archives, Berkeley DB database
files, Bzip2 archives, Character/block devices, ColorSync colour profiles (.icc),
Coreboot CBFS filesystem images, Cpio archives, Dalvik .dex files, Debian
.buildinfo files, Debian .changes files, Debian source packages (.dsc), Device Tree
Compiler blob files, Directories, ELF binaries,....................

---

# reprotest

Builds binaries twice with different variations.

https://packages.debian.org/sid/reprotest

???

Variations such as time, buildpath, disorderfs.

---

# 6. Test framework

* Torture test setup with over 75% reproducible
* Hardware sponsored by various projects
* Different distro's tested such as Arch, Coreboot, OpenWrt, Debian and F-Droid.

---

# Reproducible Build Testing

Builds packages twice with [different env's](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_variations.html):
* env vars: LANG, BUILDUSER,..
* gid/uid
* buildpath
* kernel
* CPU type

---

# Repro. Build Test Website

* [Debian test statistics](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/reproducible.html)

![Debian unstable reproducible build status](assets/test_repro_status.png)

???

Variations such as:
* LANG, BUILDUSER, gid, uid, buildpath, kernel
* CPU type, year, timezone, fs

---

# 7. Current Development

* Toolchain fixes (GCC, Go, R)
* Packages must be reproducible in a future Debian policy
* Not comparing packages against the archive
* Debian images are not reproducible [#900918](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=900918)
* Package manager integration


???

* Debian
* GCC recording buildpath/PGO
* Go?
* R?

---

# End user verification

1. $distro builds a package
2. Rebuilders verify that the package is reproducible
3. Integration in your package manager
4. Fail installation if a package is not reproducible

"Such blatant code would not go undetected for long. Even the most casual perusal of the source of the C compiler would raise suspicions"
