# 1. Attacking OSS distribution

---

"Reflections on Trusting Trust", Ken Thompson, 1984

![Figure 7](assets/trusting-trust.gif)

"Such blatant code would not go undetected for long. Even the most casual perusal of the source of the C compiler would raise suspicions"

???

Not a new problem: envisioned in 1984 by inventor of Unix

---

![Homebrew hack](assets/homebrew.png)

![nodejs hack](assets/nodejs.png)

???

Not a theoretical problem:

* august 2018: someone gained access to credentials of Homebrew dev, 




---

# 2. Defending: Reproducible Builds

---

# 3. Other advantages

* Detect security issues (private key generation on build).
* Less rebuilds due to caching results since they are the same.
* Bugs found in packages when building in different environments.
* Builds which fail X% of the time.

---

# 4. In practice

---

# 5. Problems & Tools

---

# Problems

* Dictionary/hash/database ordering
* Build paths
* Timestamps
* Non-determinismistic file ordering
* Users, groups, umask, environment variables, etc.

---

# Tools

* diffoscope
* disorderfs
* reprotest
* strip-nondeterminism

???

* diffoscope - file diff++
* disorderfs - a FUSE fs which introduces non-determinism
* reprotest- build packages twice in different environments
* strip-nondeterminism - build system tool to strip some sorts of non determinism
used by Debian

---

# diffoscope

Also known as diff on steroids


```bash
$ diffoscope badge-firmware.bin /tmp/badge-firmware.bin

```

???

Diffs two files with support for a lot of formats which are automatically 'unpacked' in the most
convenient format.

---

# reprotest

Builds binaries twice with different variations.

https://packages.debian.org/sid/reprotest

???

Variations such as time, buildpath, disorderfs.

---

# 6. Arch and Debian

* Both have a torture test setup with over 75% reproducible
* Variations differ between distro's
* Focus on user-end-verification

---

# End user verification

1. $distro builds a package
2. Rebuilders verify that the package is reproducible
3. Integration in your package manager
4. Fail installation if a package is not reproducible

---

# End user verification integration

```bash
$ apt install python-pywt-doc

# Debian

* Toolchain fixes (GCC, Go, R)
* Packages must be reproducible in a future Debian policy
* Not comparing packages against the archive
* Debian images are not reproducible [#900918](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=900918)


???

* GCC recording buildpath/PGO
* Go?
